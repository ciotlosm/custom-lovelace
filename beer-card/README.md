# Beer card üç∫

A special card for Toast and his contribution to the community. A card that displays a multiline text in a nicer format and allows for a custom icon either from sensor or specified in the config or if both missing, shows a `mdi:beer`.

Please use official custom cards examples [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/en/lovelace_custom_card.html) if you better portability.
